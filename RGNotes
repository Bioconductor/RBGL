 I am trying to write up something on the RBGL package and 
  the following seems a bit odd,
  example(dfs)
  dd2 = removeEdge("w", "t", dd)
  dd3 = removeEdge("w", "x", dd2)
  plot(dd3) #disconnected
  bfs(dd3) #seems to make no sense
  nodes(dd3)[bfs(dd3)]

 Can you please put in some words to describe what you mean by
 "both dfs and bfs can handle unconnected graphs", precisely what is
  returned in this case? The example above suggests that this is an
 untrue statement.

 Can we ever expect to be able to supply the starting node for dfs? is
 the
 problem with the interface or with the underlying code?


 thanks,

  robert

Hi Vince,
    - some more info: it seems that the problem is with directed
   versus undirected graphs

   - if you look in your vignette you have bf defined and it
    reads a graph from a file bfsex.gxl;

   - I don't think you should do this, a graphNEL has reciprocated
    edges if it is undirected; you can either use ugraph or you can
    change your fromGXL function so that if it is deserializing to
    a graphNEL object it honors the structure of the graphNEL objects

   - and it seems that dfs and bfs on the undirected graph are
   correct, but
    not on the undirected version (either using your method of simply
   changing
   the edgemode, or using ugraph)

   - I suspect something has changed in the graph representation that
     has
    never gotten propogated to RBGL, but I am not sure
##some code that shows the problem from a different perspective
set.seed(123)
g1 <- randomEGraph(LETTERS[11:20], edges=15)
g2 = addEdge(c("R","R"), c("N","K"),

g2 = addEdge(c("R","R"), c("N","K"),
              g1, c(1,1) )
 bfsg2 = bfs(g2)
 dfsg2 = dfs(g2)
 nodes(g2)[bfsg2]
 nodes(g2)[dfsg2$discovered]

(and looking at this last one, you should see Q, S, T in elements 5, 6
and 7
 but that is not possible, S has no edge to T and we have not yet
 explored
 all of S's children so we should not be going to T)


   - we have a problem in that DFS does not do what dfs does; I am not
     sure
    what we should do to fix this; should we just live with it (both
     do
    what they are documented to do)

   - is it your intention that
      nodes(g)[bfs(g)]
     should give the node labels in the order in which they are
      visited
    (and similarly for dfs)?. If so this is really what should be
     documented and I, at least, would find it very helpful to have
    an example (that did not rely on code, but rather explained in
      words what
    was supposed to happen, so that I could check the code against it)

  - I looked at tsort and wondered why its return value is different

m
   that of dfs and bfs (it seems to be more similar to that of DFS,
    but
   I think we really want a single type of return value so that it
   can be operated on).

 - also could you add something that describes just what a topological
   sort is to a naive users (perhaps explaining why a DAG is so
   important).

 - also I wonder if this is the right approach (where tsort does two
   things)
   couldn't we have a function called isDAG that does the testing and
   then have tsort error out? that seems more reasonable


  As you can see much work on the book is being done - but of course
  this raises questions about the underlying code.

 Hope all is well there,
   Robert
